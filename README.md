# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page solution

This is my solution to the [Blogr landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP). It was pretty hard for me to do, but I gained a lot of experience.

## My process

### Built with

-   HTML
-   SASS
-   Bootstrap
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I was struggling with dropdown, burger menu and layout because of shifted images. But I learned how you can mess up with code and see the consequences: hard readable code and problems with support. It was valuable experience :)

### Continued development

If you can point out my mistakes and advice me good frontend practices, I'll be very grateful!
